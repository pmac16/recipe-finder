## Introduction:
We have been tasked with building a web application from scratch. As a team, we will conceive and execute a design that solves a real- world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests to create an interactive front-end project. Working collaboratively, the group will be using agile development methodologies, implement features, bug fixes, and Git branch workflow. With this project, the group will be presenting the final product to the audience (the class) in order to convince fellow students and instructors that it serves a purpose.

Our team created an interactive website where a user can input an ingredient for meals and the response will generate a list of meals that include the ingredient, each including a name and picture, as well as a link to instructions on how to make the meal. The user can also choose which meals are their favorites from the list and add them to the My Recipes page, which will store their favorite recipes to be retrieved at a later date.

Similarly, the user can also input a type of alcohol (ie Vodka) and the response will generate a list of drinks that include the type of alcohol, each including a name, picture and instructions on how to make the drink. Just as with meals, the user can choose which drinks are their favorites from the list and add them to the My Recipes page.

## Requirements:
This project requires the following:
- GitHub
- GitBash
- VS Code
- Chrome
- HTML
- CSS (Materialize)
- Zoom (for meetings)
- Must be interactive (accept and respond to user input)
- Two server-side APIs
    - TheCocktailDB  https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php
    - TheMealDB  https://www.themealdb.com/api.php
- Cannot use alerts, confirms, or prompts
- Use client-side storage to store persistent data
- Power Point

## Configuration:
The project requires a repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, and indentation). The codebase must follow accessibility standards so that the site is optimized for search engines. The HTML elements should follow a logical structure independent of styling and position. Image elements should also have alt attributes. Heading attributes should fall in sequential order. The Title element should have a concise descriptive title.
